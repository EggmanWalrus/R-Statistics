# Overview

This tutorial reviews the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM; Kashy & Kenny, 2000; Kenny, Kashy, & Cook, 2006), which is often used to examine the association (1) between two constructs for two people using cross-sectional data, or (2) between the same construct from two people across two time points.
